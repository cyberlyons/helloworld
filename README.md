## Extra Credit: Keep on building!

Change the placeholder Octocat gif on your GitHub Pages website by [creating your own personal Octocat emoji](https://myoctocat.com/build-your-octocat/) or [choose a different Octocat gif from our logo library here](https://octodex.github.com/). Add that image to line 12 of your `index.html` file, in place of the `<img src=` link.

Want to add even more code and fun styles to your GitHub Pages website? [Follow these instructions](https://github.com/github/personal-website) to build a fully-fledged static website.
